        <p class="general">The second phase in an ethical hackerâ€™s strategy is the scanning phase. This step involves using all the information obtained in the reconnaissance phase and applying it to look for vulnerabilities in the targeted area. There are different types of scans done by ethical hackers. They can scan for open ports or different services that are running unprotected in the organization. </p>
        <p class="general2">This phase is crucial in the ethical hacking process as it provides valuable information for subsequent penetration testing or security assessment activities.</p>
        <p class="general3">This process has become automated because there are many tools available for hackers to perform vulnerability scans. </p>
