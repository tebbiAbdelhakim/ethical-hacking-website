                <p>Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization’s infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network</p>
                <br>
                <p> Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand attacks better or divert them.</p>

                <h2>Reconnaissance</h2>
                <h1>OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)</h1>
                <p>Leveraging publicly available sources of information, such as public records, domain registration details, and social media profiles, to build a comprehensive profile of the target.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="card whois">
                <h2>Reconnaissance</h2>
                <h1>WHOIS Lookups</h1>
                <p>Querying WHOIS databases to obtain information about domain ownership and registration details.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="card port-scanning">
                <h2>Scanning</h2>
                <h1>Port Scanning</h1>
                <p>Port scanning, in the context of cybersecurity, is the practice of probing a network or server to identify open ports. These ports are essentially virtual doorways that allow communication between devices on a network. By scanning for open ports, attackers can gain valuable information about the target system.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="card vuln-scanning">
                <h2>Scanning</h2>
                <h1>Vulnerability Scanning</h1>
                <p>Vulnerability scanning, often shortened to "vuln scanning," is another crucial cybersecurity practice that works hand-in-hand with port scanning. While port scanning identifies open ports and potential services, vulnerability scanning goes a step further. It analyzes these open ports and services to identify known security weaknesses and flaws that attackers could exploit.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="card banner-grabbing">
                <h2>Scanning</h2>
                <h1>Banner Grabbing</h1>
                <p>A technique used to gain informations about the computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports. Administrators can use this to take inventory of the systems and services on their Network. However an intruder can use Banner grabbing in order to find network hosts that are running versions of applications and operating systems with known exploits.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="card network-mapping">
                <h2>Scanning</h2>
                <h1>Network Mapping</h1>
                <p>Finding the topology of network, routers, firewalls servers if any, and host information and drawing a network diagram with the available information. This map may serve as a valuable piece of information throughout the haking process.</p>

                <h2>Gaining Access</h2>
                <h1>Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities</h1>
                <p>Ethical hackers may attempt to exploit known software vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services running on the target system. This can involve techniques like SQL injection, or remote code execution.</p>
                
            </div>

                <h2>Gaining Access</h2>
                <h1>Brute-forcing</h1>
                <p>This method involves systematically trying all possible combinations of username and password until a match is found. While time-consuming, it can be effective against weak passwords.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card so-en">
                <h2>Gaining Access</h2>

                <h2>Maintaining Access</h2>
                <h1>Backdoors</h1>
                <p>Backdoors provide a means for attackers to maintain persistent access to a compromised system. Unlike some other methods of unauthorized access, backdoors are designed to remain undetected over time, allowing attackers to come and go without being noticed.</p>

                <p>An intelligent hacker always clears all evidence so that in the later point of time, no one will find any traces leading to him. This involves modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of Logs, modifying registry values and uninstalling all applications he used and deleting all folders he created.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>In conclusion, ethical hacking stands as a pivotal force in fortifying our digital landscape against the ever-evolving threats of the cyber world. By harnessing the skills of ethical hackers, we empower ourselves to identify and rectify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. As we navigate the intricate web of technology, ethical hacking emerges not just as a proactive defense mechanism but as a testament to our commitment to a secure and resilient digital future. It is a symbiotic relationship between innovation and security, where ethical hackers play a crucial role in safeguarding our interconnected world. By embracing ethical hacking practices, we pave the way for a safer, more robust cyberspace, fostering trust, innovation, and progress. Together, let us continue to explore the frontiers of ethical hacking, ensuring that our digital ecosystem remains a space where security and progress go hand in hand.
