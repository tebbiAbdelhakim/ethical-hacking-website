        <p class="general">The ethical hacker collects all the  informations available about the netwoks and the systems in place,
             as well as the security measures that have been implemented.
             The primary objective at this stage is to construct a comprehensive profile of the target,
              enabling security professionals to pinpoint potential entry points for subsequent penetration testing or
               security evaluations. </p>
        <p class="active"><span>Active Information Gathering: </span>Involves directly engaging with the target system to gather information through the use of tools and techniques, some of the tools include port scanning network mapping vulnerability scanning, and more</p>
        <p class="passive"><span>Passive Information Gathering: </span>Is a method of collecting information on the targets without directly interacting with it. Like using publicly available informations. Some of the techniques used in that are social engineering, search engines, and whois records.</p>
