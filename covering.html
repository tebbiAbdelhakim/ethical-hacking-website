        <p class="general">This is the final step to complete the entire hacking process.Once the hacker gains access, they cover their tracks to escape the security personnel. They do this by clearing the cache and cookies, tampering the log files, and closing all the open ports. This step is important because it clears the system information making hacking a great deal harder to track.
        </p>
        <p class="general2">They need to cover their tracks throughout to avoid detection while entering and leaving the network or server. The security systems in place should not be able to identify the attacker. 
        </p>
        <p class="general3">The sign of a successful simulated cyber attack is if the security system never realized that an attack took place altogether.
